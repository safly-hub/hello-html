  <p>Hello Everyone,
    My Name is <em>Lucas,</em> I am 19 years old and come from <strong> Washington DC.</strong> I am trying to learn to
    code though it is extremely
    tedious and conceptually challenging. I find myself having an extremely difficult time coding and I want to do my
    best.
